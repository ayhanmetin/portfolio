// Adding Dark and Light Mode Toggle with Bootstrap: A Simple Guide
// Are you a light mode person or a dark mode person?
// According to a survey by UXDesign, 58.7% of developers prefer using dark mode for their web applications. I personally like my pages in light mode; strong eyes require strong lights! This is just a joke, of course. 
// Dark mode is amazing as it provides lower brightness when needed, especially at night. Here are two examples of dark/light switchers for your frontend project that you can use, created with Bootstrap and SVG for icons.
// Install Bootstrap =>

// npm i bootstrap@5.3.2

// and import your app =>

// import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
