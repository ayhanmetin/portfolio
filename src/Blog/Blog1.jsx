        <h2 className="mb-3">Navigational and State Commands</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><code>cy.visit()</code> and <code>cy.go()</code>:</strong> Beyond basic navigation, use these to test
          multi-page user flows, ensuring seamless transitions and state
          persistence across pages. For instance, verify that a user's shopping
          cart persists after navigating away and returning. <strong><code>cy.url()</code> and
          <code>cy.title()</code>:</strong> Leverage these to assert that URL redirections and page
          titles match expected outcomes after actions, such as completing a
          purchase, which might trigger a redirection to a success page.

        <h2 className="mb-3">Element Interaction and Assertion Commands:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><code>cy.get()</code>, <code>cy.find()</code>, and <code>cy.locator()</code>:</strong> Essential for selecting elements,
          these commands can be used in conjunction to navigate through the DOM
          efficiently. For example,
          <code>cy.get('.product-list').find('.product').locator('[data-id=1]')</code> to assert
          the presence and properties of specific items in a dynamic product list.
          <br /><strong>Assertions:</strong> Utilize Cypress's built-in assertions to test the state of
          your application rigorously. For example, after adding an item to the
          cart, assert that the cart's item count has incremented and the specific
          item's details are correctly displayed in the cart summary.

        <h2 className="mb-3">Workflow Optimization and Customization:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><code>cy.log()</code>, Custom Commands, and <code>cy.fixture()</code>:</strong> Use <code>cy.log()</code> to document test steps for easier debugging.
          Implement custom commands for repetitive tasks like adding items to the
          cart or filling out checkout forms, significantly DRYing up your test
          code. Employ <code>cy.fixture()</code> to manage test data, such as user credentials or
          product details, to be used in multiple test cases. <br /><strong>Page Object Model:</strong>
          Abstract the structure of your web application into a set of objects
          within Cypress, enabling a modular, maintainable testing strategy that
          reduces code duplication and improves test clarity.

        <h2 className="mb-3">Advanced Interactions and File Handling:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><code>cy.type()</code>, <code>cy.upload()</code>, and File Handling Commands:</strong>
          Test complex form interactions with <code>cy.type()</code>, adjusting the typing speed
          to mimic user behavior. Use <code>cy.upload()</code> to test image uploads in user
          profiles or product listings. Explore <code>cy.readFile()</code>, <code>cy.writeFile()</code>,
          <code>cy.downloadFile()</code>, and <code>cy.deleteFile()</code> for tests involving file management
          features, such as exporting order receipts or importing a bulk product
          list.

        <h2 className="mb-3">Network Requests and Mocking:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><code>cy.spy()</code>, <code>cy.mock()</code>, and <code>cy.intercept()</code>:</strong> Essential for testing API interactions, use these to mock
          network requests/responses, verifying that your application correctly
          handles API failures, slow network responses, or unexpected data
          structures.

        <h2 className="mb-3">Advanced Testing Scenarios:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><code>cy.viewport()</code>:</strong> Test your application's responsive design by simulating various devices, ensuring a
          consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
          <br /><strong><code>cy.shadow()</code>:</strong> For applications utilizing Web Components with Shadow DOM,
          this command allows you to pierce through the shadow boundary, enabling
          you to interact with and test elements within a shadow root.
          <br /><strong><code>cy.session()</code>, <code>cy.origin()</code>, and Conditional Testing (<code>cy.if</code>):</strong> Use <code>cy.session()</code> to test
          scenarios involving user sessions and authentication states. Employ
          <code>cy.origin()</code> for cross-origin testing, essential for services like payment
          gateways. Implement conditional testing to handle scenarios that might not
          always be reproducible in a test environment, such as testing promotional
          pop-ups that appear conditionally.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-5">
        <h2 className="mb-3">Parallel Testing and <code>cy.screenshot()</code>:</h2>
        <p>
          Utilize Cypress's parallel testing capabilities to speed up the test suite
          execution across multiple machines. Use <code>cy.screenshot()</code> strategically to
          capture the state of the application at key points or upon test failure
          for debugging purposes.

      <section className="mb-5">
        <h2 className="mb-3">Loading Bar and Visual Regression:</h2>
        <p>
          Implement custom commands to test UI elements like loading bars, ensuring they
          appear and disappear as expected. Additionally, integrate visual
          regression testing tools to catch unintended CSS changes.

        <h2 className="mb-3">Reporting and CI/CD Integration:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Awesome Reports and Cypress Dashboard:</strong> Take advantage
          of Cypress's reporting capabilities to generate comprehensive test
          reports, integrating with the Cypress Dashboard for real-time monitoring
          of test runs, especially useful in CI/CD pipelines.
