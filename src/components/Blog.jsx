            This blog post shows a few different types of content thatâ€™s
            supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists,
            tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.

            This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been
            written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of
            text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep
            the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same
            string of text.
